      <h2>Here's a time line of Edward Snowden's life:</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">June 21, 1983</span>: Born in Elizabeth City, N.C. 
      </p>
      <p><span class="bold">1998</span>: Snowden drops out of high school in his sophomore year.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">1999</span>: Develops a fascination with computers and technology and registers on the Ars Technica website, a hacking and technology forum. Over a two-year period Snowden posts as “Hooha” about role-playing video games. 
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">2004</span>: Lands a job as a security guard at the Center for Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland, which has a close relationship with the National Security Agency.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">2006</span>: Snowden is hired by the CIA as a technical/IT expert and receives a top-secret clearance.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">2007-2009</span>: Snowden is posted to Geneva, Switzerland, under diplomatic cover as an IT and cyber security expert for the CIA, a position that gives him access to a wide array of classified documents.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">2009-2012</span>: Snowden’s supervisor at the CIA placed a critical assessment of his behavior and work habits in his personnel file and voiced the suspicion that he had tried to “break into classified computer files to which he was not authorized to have access,”. Snowden leaves the CIA soon after and begins work as a NSA contractor assigned by Dell with top-secret clearance working for the federal government. Over the next several years, he switches between assignments with the NSA and CIA for Dell.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">Dec. 1, 2012</span>: Snowden reaches out to Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer and columnist for The Guardian.
      </p>  

      <p><span class="bold">Jan. 2013</span>: Snowden reaches out to Laura Poitras, a documentary filmmaker.
      </p>

      <p>March 2013: He seeks a new contractor job with Booz Allen Hamilton at the same NSA facility in Hawaii.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">May 2013</span>: Snowden begins sending some documents to Poitras, Greenwald and to Barton Gellman of the Washington Post. Snowden meets them in Hong Kong at the beginning of June, without his NSA supervisor or his girlfriend knowing the real reason for the time off he is taking.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">June 5, 2013</span>: First revelations arising from the documents provided by Snowden are published in a Guardian article about the NSA’s collection of domestic email and telephone metadata from Verizon as part of what is later revealed to be an even broader collection effort.
      </p>

      <p class="space-top">From that moment on, the revelations made from the documents provided by Snowden continued for almost a year: </p>

      <ul class="indent">
        <li><span class="bold">June 6</span> - The Guardian and the Washington Post each publish an article about the NSA program PRISM, which forces biggest US internet companies to hand over data on domestic users.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">June 8</span> - The Guardian publishes slides which shows NSA collected nearly 3 billion pieces of intelligence inside the U.S. in February 2013 alone.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">June 9</span> - The Guardian reveals Edward Snowden as the source of the NSA leaks.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">June 11</span> - Snowden is fired by Booz Allen Hamilton.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">June 12</span> – The South China Morning Post publishes an interview with Snowden in which he says that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">June 14</span> - The U.S. Justice Department charges Snowden.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">June 23</span> - Snowden leaves Hong Kong for Ecuador, with a planned stopover in Russia. But he is stranded at the International Airport in Moscow after U.S. authorities rescind his passport. He spends the next month living in limbo in the airport’s transit center.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Aug. 1</span> - He is granted temporary asylum by Russian authorities as they consider his application for permanent political asylum.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Aug. 1</span> - The Guardian publishes an article detailing NSA funding for British intelligence because U.K. can collect data that would illegal for NSA to do, based on documents provided by Snowden.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Oct. 14</span> - The Washington Post reports on documents revealing that the NSA collects over 250 million email inbox views and contact lists a year from online services like Yahoo, Gmail and Facebook. The documents, provided by Snowden, show the agency collects the data in bulk from massive fiber optic cables that carry most of the world's telephone and Internet traffic.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Dec. 16</span> - U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rules that the NSA’s gathering of data on all telephone calls made in the United States appears to violate the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable searches. But Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, puts his ruling on hold to allow the government to appeal.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Dec. 27</span> - Another federal judge, U.S. District Judge William Pauley III in Manhattan, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, reaches an opposite conclusion, ruling that the NSA’s collection of phone data is legal.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Jan. 27, 2014</span> - Based on Snowden documents, NBC News reports that British cyber spies demonstrated a pilot program to their U.S. partners in 2012 in which they were able to monitor YouTube in real time and collect addresses from the billions of videos watched daily, as well as some user information, for analysis. At the time, they were also able to spy on Facebook and Twitter.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Feb. 7</span> - NBC News reports, based on Snowden documents, that British spies have developed “dirty tricks” for use against nations, hackers, terror groups, suspected criminals and arms dealers that include releasing computer viruses, spying on journalists and diplomats, jamming phones and computers, and using sex to lure targets into “honey traps.”</li>
      <li><span class="bold">March 10</span> - In a teleconference appearance from Moscow, Snowden tells a crowd at the South by Southwest music and technology festival in Austin, Texas, that the NSA and its counterparts are "setting fire to the future of the Internet," and urges technologists in attendance to “help us fix this.”</li>
      <li><span class="bold">April 17</span> - Snowden appears via webcam on Russian television to ask President Vladimir Putin about whether Russia conducts mass surveillance of civilians. The softball setup — Putin replied with a resounding "no," adding that he is against spying on his people — was generally seen as a PR stunt. But in a subsequent opinion column in The Guardian, Snowden defends his line of questioning and notes that Putin was evasive in his response.</li>
