        <span><h3>DOMAINE MÉO-CAMUZET</h3>
        <p>Jean-Nicolas Méo briefly described 2019 as another "hot and dry vintage that produced high fruit maturities. We picked from the 13th of September and the bunches were exceptionally clean so there wasn’t much sorting required save for a few sunburned berries. I would call the yields correct, which is to say about 20% lower than what we obtained in 2018 but since yields were generous, essentially 2019 gave us normal volumes. Alcohols were on the higher side as they mostly came in between 13.8 and 14.3% with better acidities than in 2018. We vinified carefully as the fruit had a very high level of extractability and it would have been easy to unbalance the wines with too much tannin but otherwise, there was no drama with the vinifications.</br>
